# Caf-Wall-Illusion
This optical illusion was first discovered by Dr. Richard Gregory
who observed an anomaly in the way that the tiles of a wall in his
local caf√© in Bristol displayed. The horizontal lines appear to be
bent, although they in fact parallel straight horizonal lines. The
effect only works if the tiles have a border (in this case grey).
